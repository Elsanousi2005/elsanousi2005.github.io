I'm Mostafa Elsanousi, a Virginia Tech student from Khartoum, Sudan, pursuing a path in computer engineering with a strong interest in chip-scale integration, embedded systems, and VLSI design. My passion lies in understanding how hardware and software converge at the circuit level to create efficient, reliable, and scalable systems.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to make technology more accessible, I aim to develop innovative hardware solutions that enhance connectivity, efficiency, and performance, particularly for communities where such advancements can have the greatest impact.

Ultimately, I hope to contribute to the development of advanced integrated circuits and embedded architectures that push the boundaries of efficiency, scalability, and accessibility in modern computing systems.
